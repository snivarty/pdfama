# UI Update
We'll add a chat input field and a message display area to our popup.html.
# Vector Database
We will integrate LanceDB WASM into our popup.js to store and search the document's content.
# Indexing
We will fully implement the handleChatIndexing function. It will take the full PDF text, chunk it into paragraphs, get an embedding for each chunk from a Gemini API, and store them in LanceDB.
# Chat Logic
When you type a question, we will get an embedding for your question, use LanceDB to find the most relevant text chunks from the PDF, and then send a carefully crafted prompt to the Gemini API to generate an answer based on that context.
